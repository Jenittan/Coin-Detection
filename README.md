# ü™ô Coin Detection using OpenCV

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook **Coin-Detection.ipynb** that demonstrates coin detection using **Python** and **OpenCV**.  
The project identifies and counts coins in an image by applying image preprocessing, contour detection, and circle detection techniques.

---

## üìñ Overview
The main goal of this project is to **automatically detect coins** from an image based on their circular shape and size.  
It uses techniques like:
- Grayscale conversion  
- Gaussian blurring  
- Edge detection (Canny or HoughCircles)  
- Contour detection and filtering  
- Drawing bounding circles and counting coins

## üß∞ Technologies Used
- **Python 3.8+**
- **OpenCV**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib** (optional for visualization)
